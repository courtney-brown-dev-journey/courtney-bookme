            <p>
                Welcome to my work in progress website. I am currently studying at Enspiral's Dev Academy in Wellington, New Zealand. This is a website that I'm building to test out my skills and what I've been learning, as well as showcase the books that I've read over the last few years.

                  <h3>Books!</h3>
            <p>
                Here you'll be able to look at genres that you're interested in. You'll be able to see my top reads and be able to browse the books I've read by year.
